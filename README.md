Fluid Dynamics in the Lungs - Xray Detection using Resnet50

Spotting irregularities in X-ray images of the Lungs. What kind of anomaly are we looking for? What shape do these anomalies take? Let's investigate the answers to these issues.

The main reason for the storage of water in the lungs is due a condition called Pleural Effusion, Pulmonary edema or Tuberculosis. Pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, and tuberculosis (TB) are three distinct medical conditions that affect the respiratory system, each with different causes and characteristics.

1. Pleural Effusion: Pleural effusion refers to the accumulation of fluid in the pleural space, the space between the layers of the pleura (thin membranes that line the lungs and chest cavity). It can be caused by various factors, including infections, heart failure, liver disease, cancer, kidney disease, or autoimmune conditions. Pleural effusion is not the same as pulmonary edema or tuberculosis.
1. Pulmonary Edema: Pulmonary edema occurs when there is an abnormal accumulation of fluid in the lungs, which can impair the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the respiratory system. 
1. Tuberculosis: Tuberculosis, on the other hand, is a contagious bacterial infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It primarily affects the lungs but can also affect other organs in the body. TB is spread through the air when an infected individual coughs or sneezes, and it can be transmitted to others who inhale the bacteria. While pulmonary tuberculosis can lead to lung damage and inflammation, it does not typically result in pulmonary edema directly. However, in rare cases, complications of tuberculosis, such as disseminated TB or miliary TB, can cause inflammation and fluid accumulation in the lungs, which may resemble pulmonary edema.

----------------------------------------------
**Common causes of pleural effusion include:**

* Infections: Certain infections can lead to pleural effusion, such as pneumonia, tuberculosis (TB), fungal infections, or viral infections like influenza.
* Heart failure: Congestive heart failure can cause increased pressure in the blood vessels of the lungs, leading to the leakage of fluid into the pleural space.
* Kidney disease: Conditions like kidney failure, nephrotic syndrome, or renal impairment can result in fluid retention and pleural effusion.
* Liver disease: Liver cirrhosis, hepatitis, or other liver diseases can cause an imbalance in fluid dynamics and contribute to the development of pleural effusion.
* Cancer: Certain cancers, including lung cancer, breast cancer, lymphoma, or metastatic cancers that spread to the lungs or pleura, can cause pleural effusion.
* Pulmonary embolism: A blood clot in the lungs, known as a pulmonary embolism, can cause inflammation and fluid accumulation in the pleural space.
* Autoimmune disorders: Autoimmune conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), or vasculitis can be associated with pleural effusion.
* Trauma or injury: Chest trauma, such as a rib fracture, can damage the pleura and lead to pleural effusion.
* Certain medications: Certain medications, such as certain chemotherapy drugs, can cause pleural effusion as a side effect.
* Other causes: Other less common causes of pleural effusion include pancreatic disease, asbestos exposure, pulmonary embolism, or lymphatic system disorders.

It's important to note that these are general causes, and in some cases, the cause of pleural effusion may remain unknown (idiopathic). A thorough evaluation by a healthcare professional, including imaging tests, laboratory analysis, and sometimes a procedure called thoracentesis (draining the fluid for analysis), may be required to determine the underlying cause of pleural effusion and guide appropriate treatment.

-----------------------------------------------------------

**There are several causes of Pulmonary Edema, including:**

* Heart failure: This is the most common cause of pulmonary edema. When the heart is unable to pump blood effectively, it can lead to fluid backup in the lungs.
* Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): ARDS is a severe lung condition that can result from various factors, such as infection, trauma, or inhaling harmful substances.
* Kidney problems: Impaired kidney function can lead to fluid retention in the body, including the lungs.
* Infections: Severe lung infections, such as pneumonia, can cause inflammation and fluid accumulation in the lungs.
* High altitude: Rapid exposure to high altitudes can cause fluid to leak into the lungs due to changes in pressure.
* The presence of water in the lungs affects human beings by interfering with normal breathing and gas exchange. Symptoms of pulmonary edema can include shortness of breath, coughing, wheezing, rapid breathing, chest pain, and in severe cases, respiratory distress.

**Here are some reasons why a person may get tuberculosis:**

* Close Contact: Spending time in close proximity to someone with active TB increases the risk of infection. This is especially true in crowded places, such as households, hospitals, correctional facilities, and homeless shelters.
* Weakened Immune System: People with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV/AIDS, malnutrition, or certain medical conditions (e.g., diabetes, cancer, organ transplantation), have a higher susceptibility to TB infection. The immune system plays a crucial role in controlling the bacteria and preventing the development of active TB disease.
* Age: Infants, young children, and the elderly are more vulnerable to TB due to their developing or weakened immune systems.
* Living Conditions: Poor living conditions, overcrowding, inadequate ventilation, and lack of access to healthcare facilities increase the risk of TB transmission.
* Healthcare Workers: Healthcare workers who come in close contact with TB patients without proper protection are at an increased risk of contracting TB.
* Travel: Traveling to or living in areas with high TB prevalence, particularly in resource-limited settings or countries with limited healthcare infrastructure, can increase the risk of exposure to TB.
* Drug Resistance: Drug-resistant TB occurs when the bacteria become resistant to standard TB medications due to inadequate treatment or improper use of antibiotics. Drug-resistant TB is more difficult to treat and poses an additional risk.

It's important to note that not everyone exposed to the TB bacteria becomes infected or develops active TB disease. Many individuals have latent TB infection, meaning the bacteria are present in the body but not causing symptoms or spreading. However, latent TB can progress to active TB disease if the immune system becomes weakened.

--------------------------------------------------------
X-ray imaging can be helpful in identifying the presence of TB or pulmonary edema. It can show the accumulation of fluid in the lungs and provide insights into the underlying cause. However, the specific treatment for TB and pulmonary edema depends on its cause. For example, if heart failure is the underlying cause, medications to improve heart function may be prescribed. Diuretics may also be given to remove excess fluid from the body. In some cases, supplemental oxygen or mechanical ventilation may be necessary to support breathing.

**Deep learning can be used to accurately detect various diseases by spotting anomalies in X-rays and availability of open-source photos/xrays has made it simpler to apply deep learning to medical imaging. We will use X-Ray images from CXR dataset and resnet50 in this case study****
